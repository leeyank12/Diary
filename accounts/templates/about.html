  <h2>Our Story</h2>
  <p>
    DiaryGo started with a simple belief — that every family deserves fresh, pure, and chemical-free milk directly from the farmers who produce it. 
    In many villages and small towns, milk is still collected in its purest form every morning, but it often loses quality once it enters traditional market chains. 
    We wanted to change this.
  </p>

  <h2>Why DiaryGo Was Created</h2>
  <p>
    The idea of DiaryGo came from observing how milk travels through multiple hands, gets processed, and often loses its natural purity. 
    Our vision was to create a system where milk goes **directly from the farmer to the customer**, without preservatives, without unnecessary processing, 
    and without compromising freshness.
  </p>

  <p>
    We also wanted to build a platform that is **transparent** — where customers know exactly where their milk comes from, 
    and farmers are rewarded fairly for the work they put in every day.  
  </p>

  <h2>Eco-Friendly Delivery Approach</h2>
  <p>
    One of our key goals is to make dairy delivery more eco-friendly.  
    Instead of traditional plastic packets, DiaryGo promotes the use of **steel cans and large reusable containers** to transport milk.  
    These containers:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Preserve the natural temperature and freshness</li>
    <li>Reduce plastic waste significantly</li>
    <li>Keep the milk chemical-free and untouched</li>
    <li>Help maintain true farm-to-home purity</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Our eco-friendly delivery idea first spread across **villages and small towns**, where customers still prefer traditional ways of receiving milk.  
    Now, we are working to bring this experience to cities as well.
  </p>

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    We aim to build a trustworthy system where:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Farmers get fair prices and respect for their hard work</li>
    <li>Customers receive genuine, unadulterated dairy</li>
    <li>Delivery is clean, eco-friendly, and reliable</li>
    <li>Every step in the process is transparent</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="highlight">
    <h3>Our Quality Promise</h3>
    <p>Every batch of milk is checked using:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lactometer Test</strong> — checks purity and density</li>
      <li><strong>Foam / Shake Test</strong> — detects detergents or chemicals</li>
      <li><strong>Cream & Fat Check</strong> — ensures natural richness</li>
      <li><strong>Smell Test</strong> — identifies freshness instantly</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Milk is accepted only after passing these tests.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Growing With Farmers & Communities</h2>
  <p>
    DiaryGo works closely with local farmers who follow ethical and traditional dairy practices.  
    Their dedication ensures that every litre of milk you receive is fresh and naturally produced with care.
  </p>

  <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
  <p>
    What started as an idea in small rural communities is now growing rapidly.  
    We are expanding into more towns and cities and improving our delivery methods every day.
  </p>

  <p>
    We welcome individuals, farmers, partners, and dairy units who want to collaborate with us.  
    Whether you want to supply milk, join our delivery team, or bring your dairy products to our customers — DiaryGo is open to working with you.
  </p>

  <p><strong>At DiaryGo, we are building a future where dairy is honest, pure, eco-friendly, and farmer-powered.</strong></p>
